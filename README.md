This is one of my oldest apps. It has gone through many iterations. Many of which were never logged or kept track of through a versioning system like Git. It's been trimmed, overhauled, refined and slimmed down to be more fluid and simple. This is one my favorite projects. Whenever I learn something new I love coming back to apply my knowledge on it.

Enough of the small talk. Let's get down to business. Musica is an OS X app that controls your iTunes, Rdio, Spotify and Radium music players. It shows an album artwork window with pause, previous and forward controls. Double clicking the artwork will activate the relevant app. Musica can be hidden when no music is playing. Artwork has been borrowed from my other project, Music Swipe. My favorite little tidbit is that Musica bounces when it detects new artwork. Musica also works with Notification Center. Oh and one more thing, Musica is smart enough to figure out what music player you are using if you happen to have more than one open. If it isn't sure it will let ask you which one to use. I wrote this in because The Icon Factory told me it couldn't be done for Take Five so I wanted to prove them wrong. I didn't write logic for having 3 players open though.
