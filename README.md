Musica
======

This is one of my oldest apps. It has gone through many iterations. Many of which were never logged or kept track of through a versioning system like Git. It's been trimmed, overhauled, refined and slimmed down to be more fluid and simple. This is one my favorite projects. Whenever I learn something new I love coming back to apply my knowledge on it.

Musica is a replacement for Bowtie. While I can’t guarantee 100% compatibility with themes it’s worked for me pretty great thus far. If you want to pitch a hand, send me a pull request then and I’ll check it out. Not everything you’d expect from the application is entirely there. To install a new theme you’ll need to go the menu and hit Open to install a new theme. Alternatively you can just drop it in the Application Support folder (I can’t promise it’ll always be located there though!) named the same as the app.

Current application support:
* iTunes
* Rdio
* Radium
* Spotify
* Vox
